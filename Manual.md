## Printing the parts
* Suggested printing orientation for the parts
* The gaskets are printed with flexible filament with a hardness around 95A
* No supports should be needed to print these parts

## Assembling the case
### Preparing the switchplate
1. Assemble the switchplate by snapping the PCB to the switchplate. The snap-fit joints on the switchplate are fragile, do not bend these or they might break. If more room is needed use the gasket mounts to bend the switchplate slightly to manouvre the PCB in place.
2. Place the six gaskets on the gasketmounts surrounding the switchplate.
3. Assemble the switchplate further with the switches of choice (and screen if used)

### Preparing the top housing
1. Place the top housing face down and use a soldering iron to insert the eleven m3x4mm threaded inserts into the blue highlighted holes.

2. Depending on if you want to use the Le Chiffre with or withough a knob, screen or extra button, snap the corresponding window insert plate via the underside of the top housing into place. The insert plate should sit flush with the top housing.

#### Assembling the case
1. Place the assembled switchplate in the top housing and set it face down, the gaskets should not fit snug in the top housing but there also should not be any sideways movement.
2. Assemble the case by placing the bottom housing on the top housing and fasten the case using the eleven m3x6mm sockethead screws.
3. The case is now assembled! Finish the build with your keycaps of choise and enjoy your keyboard!
